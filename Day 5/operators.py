# # Example 1: Combining arithmetic operators
# result = 10 + 5 - 3 * 2 / 4
# print(result)  # Output: 12.5 (10 + 5 - 3 * 2 / 4 = 12.5)

# # Example 2: Combining comparison operators
# x = 5
# y = 10
# z = 15
# result = x < y <= z

# # Example 3: Combining logical operators
# a = True
# b = False
# c = True
# result = a and b or c
# print(result)  # Output: True ((a and b) or c)
